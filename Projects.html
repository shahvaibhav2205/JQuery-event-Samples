	<li><b>Energy Efficient Communication in Wireless Sensor Networks</b> (<u>Oct-14 to Dec-14</u>)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Designed and implemented an energy-efficient communication application for wireless sensor networks.</li>
			<li>Designed a spanning tree construction algorithm with precise design and implementation a protocol <br>
				for energy efficient- collection of the requested statistics in the network. Technology used was Java.</li>
		</ul>
	<li><b>Implementation of Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms 	</b>(<u>Aug-13 to Dec-14</u>)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Implemented:<br> 
			(1)Better Merge Sort using an Auxiliary Array, <br>
			(2) Multi-Dimensional Search using Trees, <br>
			(3) Minimum Spanning Tree of a Directed Graph, <br>
			(4) Light approximate shortest path tree using MST by prims algorithm and shortest<br> 
			paths of all other vertex from node is implemented using Bellman Ford algorithm. <br>
			Technology used was Java.
			</li>
		</ul>	
	<li><b>Authentication using Session based passwords	</b>	(<u>Aug-13 to May-14</u>)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Eased out the problem of unauthorized access into a system. Earlier it was very <br>
			time consuming and tedious for users to remember the graphical methods and save it from <br>
			the people peeping into their monitors. The Technique addressed these issues and brought a <br>
			solution to their problem.</li>
			<li>
				Proposed three authentication schemes for generating the session passwords which<br>
				is identified as the primary level of authentication. This method is resistant to<br>
				shoulder surfing attacks. The technology used for server side coding was done using<br> 
				PHP, web pages and interfaces using JavaScript, ASP, AJAX and CSS and database used under MySQL.
			</li>
		</ul>
	<li><b>Implementation of an ETL tool	</b>(<u>Sept-12 to Nov-12)</u>	</li>
		<ul>
		<li>
			Extracted data from sources such as Text file, MS Access file and a Database to be <br>
			transformed then loaded and stored in one single file for further analysis. <br>
			This project was under subject Database technologies.		</li>
		</ul>
